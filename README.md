==========

Fast implementation of some Continuous Wavelet Transforms.


This aims to be a very efficient implementation of CWT. The
tradeoff is that it only supports (so far) 1-D arrays of
float32/float64.

This code is an extract of my application. I have tested it
works to the precision I need. The code is not as clean as it
could be, and I don't know how much time I could put to develop
this further. No no promises here!

If this is of any use to you, please, feel free to fork and let
me know, I may be able to help.
